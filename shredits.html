  <p class="vid-title">Wednesday Funk</p>
  <p>Filmed on a super funky wednesday.</p>
  <p class="vid-description">This was my very first surf edit. Super janky, but nonetheless, one of my proudest accomplisments. Filmed this on my OG dad cam, a Sony handycam that only uses mini dvds. It was my first time ever really offering to film clips, so I wasn't really sure what I was doing. I thought <i>how hard could this be? i'm just filming</i> but it was tough. Everyone looked exactly the same -- all black wetsuits and shortboards, and it was crowded as heck. </p>

  <p class="vid-title">NEW YORK</p>
  <p class="vid-description">I  brought my point and shoot and manual with me to New York. I only shot on my point and shoot though because I broke the neck strap on my manual and didn’t want to carry around a camera that couldn’t fit into my bag or pocket. I wish I didn’t break that dang strap. Oh, also this was my first time working with b&w. I love it. I think I might only shoot b&w from now on. It’ll be like we’ve turned back the time because growing up is weird and gnarly and fast. It’ll be warm somehow, even though it lacks any and all color. Actually it’ll show the true warmth of the world. Color is beautiful but can easily dress things up. Give me the real deal please and thank u. </p>
